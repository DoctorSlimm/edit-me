## Integration Plan

# Comic Sans Global Font Implementation

This plan outlines the implementation of Comic Sans as the primary font across an application, detailing the steps for applying it globally, ensuring accessibility, and maintaining performance standards.

## Implementation Plan

# Overview and Objectives

Apply Comic Sans globally as the primary font across all UI elements via the root CSS stylesheet (`/app/globals.css`). This includes code blocks, tables, form inputs, and all technical content.

Use font stack: Comic Sans, cursive, sans-serif for accessibility fallbacks. All elements inherit this setting with no component-level exceptions.

Success criteria: Comic Sans renders consistently across all elements with proper system fallback support.

# Requirements and Constraints

**Functional Requirements:** Apply Comic Sans as primary font in `:root` CSS with fallbacks (Comic Sans, cursive, sans-serif). Affects all elements: headings, body, form inputs, code blocks, tables. Existing font variables remain available for component-specific overrides but do not override root declaration.

**Non-Functional Requirements:** Comic Sans must not degrade performance or page load time compared to current Geist font stack. Must meet WCAG contrast standards on white (#ffffff) and dark (#0a0a0a) backgrounds. Font scaling and zoom must remain functional. Traditional CSS file structure with global stylesheet and component-scoped CSS.

**Backward Compatibility:** Existing component styles, CSS classes, and custom font overrides (ChiKareGo) remain unchanged. Forms render with Comic Sans through root cascade.

# Technical Architecture

## CSS Strategy

Comic Sans is set in the global stylesheet (globals.css) at the root level with fallback stack: Comic Sans, cursive, sans-serif. The font-family rule on the body element applies universally across all components, code blocks, tables, form inputs, and technical content through CSS inheritance. No component-level overrides are required.

## Implementation

Modify font-family in globals.css body selector. This leverages existing CSS cascade behavior to apply Comic Sans application-wide without refactoring components, middleware, or custom font loading mechanisms.

# Implementation Strategy

## CSS Update

Modify `/app/globals.css`: Update `--font-sans` variable to `'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif` and change the `body` font-family rule from `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif` to `'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif`. Remove Geist font imports from `/app/layout.tsx` (lines 2, 7-15). Comic Sans is system-available; no CDN or external delivery required.

## Affected Components

All elements inherit from `:root` and `body` via Tailwind cascade. Components in `/app/page.tsx` (header, links, marquee text, counter) and `/app/components/ChatWoot.tsx` (form inputs, buttons, labels) automatically apply the font. Code blocks and technical content use the same global font stack.

## Testing & Deployment

Run `npm run dev` to verify Comic Sans renders across the page, form inputs, and animations (snowflakes, marquee). Run `next build` to confirm compilation. No visual regression expected; fallback fonts activate if Comic Sans unavailable on user systems.

# Data Structures and Interfaces

Comic Sans replaces all font declarations globally via single CSS modification in `globals.css` body element. Font stack: `Comic Sans, cursive, sans-serif`. Current `body` declaration uses `font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif` (line 25); change to Comic Sans. All elements—code blocks, form inputs, tables, technical content—inherit automatically.

No API changes. No data structure modifications. No TypeScript interface updates required. Layout.tsx font imports (`Geist`, `Geist_Mono`, `fontChiKaReGo`) remain unchanged; font-family declaration alone overrides all typography via CSS cascade. CSS variables in globals.css (lines 8-13) reference `--font-geist-sans` and `--font-geist-mono`; reassign to Comic Sans if needed or leave unchanged since body declaration takes precedence.

Implementation requires single edit: change `font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif` to `font-family: Comic Sans, cursive, sans-serif` in body selector (globals.css line 25).

# Component Interactions and System Integration

Comic Sans applies globally via the `:root` CSS variable in `globals.css` with fallback pattern `Comic Sans, cursive, sans-serif`. This cascades to all DOM elements including form inputs, code blocks, and tables. The global rule overrides Tailwind utility classes (`font-mono`, `font-bold`) and existing inline style attributes (`fontFamily: "monospace"`, `--font-chikarego`).

Component styling is processed at build time through PostCSS variable resolution in `globals.css`, Next.js font loading chain (`--font-geist-sans`, `--font-geist-mono`, `--font-chikarego` CSS variables), and Tailwind CSS v4 theme imports. The Home page `font-mono` utility class, ChatWoot inline `fontFamily: "monospace"` on buttons and containers, and textarea/input `--font-chikarego` CSS variables are all replaced by the global Comic Sans rule in the cascade.

Third-party script content (`react-grab` loaded via `<Script>`) and all heading elements inherit Comic Sans through system font inheritance. No CSS-in-JS runtime modifications needed; stylesheet processing applies changes at build time.

# Testing, Validation, and Measurement

## Visual Regression Testing

Compare screenshots before and after Comic Sans implementation in globals.css. Verify font applies consistently to all elements: code blocks, tables, form inputs, and technical content.

## Cross-Browser Validation

Test rendering across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Verify font stack `Comic Sans, cursive, sans-serif` activates fallbacks when Comic Sans unavailable. Confirm consistent rendering on iOS Safari and Chrome Android.

## Success Metrics

Font loads without exceeding baseline paint time. WCAG AA contrast ratio maintained (4.5:1 minimum). Component testing completion confirms Comic Sans applies globally via CSS root.

# Edge Cases, Failure Modes, and Risk Mitigation

**Font loading failures revert to cursive, then sans-serif.** Global stylesheet applies Comic Sans as primary font via CSS root. Fallback cascade (`Comic Sans, cursive, sans-serif`) prevents complete typography collapse across browsers without WOFF2 support (IE11, older mobile browsers).

**Code blocks and form inputs render in Comic Sans.** All elements including `<code>`, `<pre>`, tables, and form inputs inherit the global font. No monospace fallback specified. Older browsers with poor Comic Sans rendering on technical content experience reduced readability.

**Font loading blocks rendering with delayed fallback.** Browsers revert to fallback fonts while loading. Font file size, CDN delivery across regions, and network conditions determine load duration and visual impact.
