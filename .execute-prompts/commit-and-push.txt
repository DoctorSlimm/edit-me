You are committing and pushing the integration changes to the repository.

TASK: Commit and push all changes made during the integration.

STEPS:
1. Check git status to see what files were changed
2. Add all changed files: git add .
3. Create a descriptive commit message based on the integration
4. Commit the changes: git commit -m "your message"
5. Push the changes: git push

HANDLING MERGE CONFLICTS:
If the push fails due to remote changes:
1. Pull the latest changes: git pull --rebase
2. If there are merge conflicts:
   - Check which files have conflicts: git status
   - Read the conflicting files and resolve conflicts manually
   - Look for conflict markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
   - Keep the appropriate changes (usually prefer your integration changes)
   - Stage the resolved files: git add <file>
   - Continue the rebase: git rebase --continue
3. Once conflicts are resolved, push again: git push
4. If pull/rebase fails repeatedly, try: git pull --no-rebase, then push

IMPORTANT:
- Use a clear commit message that describes the integration (e.g., "feat: integrate Stripe payments")
- Make sure ALL changes from the integration are included
- Handle merge conflicts carefully - prefer keeping the integration changes
- Keep retrying until the push succeeds
- If you encounter any git errors, read the error message and follow the suggested fix
