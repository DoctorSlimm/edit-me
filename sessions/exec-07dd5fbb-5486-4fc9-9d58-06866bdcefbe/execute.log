This is a bug in Next.js.\n```\n\n**Context:**\n- The error occurred while prerendering the `/_global-error` page\n- This appears to be an internal Next.js issue related to async storage management\n- The build process was terminated before completion\n\n### Error Location\n```\nExport encountered an error on /_global-error/page: /_global-error, exiting the build.\nNext.js build worker exited with code: 1\n```\n\n### Additional Warnings\n1. **Baseline browser mapping data is outdated** - The `baseline-browser-mapping` module data is over two months old\n2. **Peer dependency mismatches** - `@testing-library/react` has unmet peer dependencies with React 19 (it expects React 18)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe project **does not currently build successfully**. There is a critical Next.js internal error that must be resolved before the build can succeed. This appears to be related to the `/_global-error` page rendering and may require investigation into the error boundary configuration or Next.js version compatibility."}
